Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the healthcare industry, offering new possibilities in diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. From machine learning algorithms that can analyze medical images to natural language processing tools that help in the interpretation of clinical notes, AI has the potential to revolutionize how healthcare is delivered.

One of the most promising applications of AI is in the field of medical imaging. Machine learning models are now able to detect diseases like cancer at an early stage with greater accuracy than traditional methods. For example, AI-powered software can analyze mammograms to identify tumors that may be missed by the human eye. This can lead to earlier diagnoses and better patient outcomes.
