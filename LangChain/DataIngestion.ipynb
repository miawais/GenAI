For other uses, see Transformer (disambiguation).\\nAn O-core transformer consisting of two coils of copper wire wrapped around a magnetic core\\nIn electrical engineering, a transformer is a passive component that transfers electrical energy from one electrical circuit to another circuit, or multiple circuits. A varying current in any coil of the transformer produces a varying magnetic flux in the transformer\\'s core, which induces a varying electromotive force (EMF) across any other coils wound around the same core. Electrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. Faraday\\'s law of induction, discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\\nTransformers are used to change AC voltage levels, such transformers being termed step-up or step-down type to increase or decrease voltage level, respectively. Transformers can also be used to provide galvanic isolation between circuits as well as to couple stages of signal-processing circuits. Since the invention of the first constant-potential transformer in 1885, transformers have become essential for the transmission, distribution, and utilization of alternating current electric power.[1] A wide range of transformer designs is encountered in electronic and electric power applications. Transformers range in size from RF transformers less than a cubic centimeter in volume, to units weighing hundreds of tons used to interconnect the power grid.\\n\\n\\n\\nPrinciples[edit]\\n\\n\\nIdeal transformer equations\\nBy Faraday\\'s law of induction:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n=\\n−\\n\\nN\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nΦ\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle V_{\\\\text{P}}=-N_{\\\\text{P}}{\\\\frac {\\\\mathrm {d} \\\\Phi }{\\\\mathrm {d} t}}}\\n\\n  (Eq. 1[a][2])\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n=\\n−\\n\\nN\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nΦ\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nt\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle V_{\\\\text{S}}=-N_{\\\\text{S}}{\\\\frac {\\\\mathrm {d} \\\\Phi }{\\\\mathrm {d} t}}}\\n\\n  (Eq. 2)\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle V}\\n\\n is the instantaneous voltage, \\n\\n\\n\\nN\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle N}\\n\\n is the number of turns in a winding, dΦ/dt is the derivative of the magnetic flux Φ through one turn of the winding over time (t), and subscripts P and S denotes primary and secondary.\\nCombining the ratio of eq. 1 & eq. 2:\\n\\nTurns ratio \\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\nN\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\nN\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\na\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle ={\\\\frac {V_{\\\\text{P}}}{V_{\\\\text{S}}}}={\\\\frac {N_{\\\\text{P}}}{N_{\\\\text{S}}}}=a}\\n\\n  (Eq. 3)\\nwhere for a step-up transformer a < 1 and for a step-down transformer a > 1.[3]\\nBy the law of conservation of energy, apparent, real and reactive power are each conserved in the input and output:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nS\\n=\\n\\nI\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\nI\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle S=I_{\\\\text{P}}V_{\\\\text{P}}=I_{\\\\text{S}}V_{\\\\text{S}}}\\n\\n  (Eq. 4)\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle S}\\n\\n is apparent power and \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle I}\\n\\n is current.\\nCombining Eq. 3 & Eq. 4 with this endnote[b][4] gives the ideal transformer identity:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\nN\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\nN\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nL\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\nL\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\na\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\frac {V_{\\\\text{P}}}{V_{\\\\text{S}}}}={\\\\frac {I_{\\\\text{S}}}{I_{\\\\text{P}}}}={\\\\frac {N_{\\\\text{P}}}{N_{\\\\text{S}}}}={\\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {L_{\\\\text{P}}}{L_{\\\\text{S}}}}}=a}\\n\\n  (Eq. 5)\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\nL\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle L}\\n\\n is winding self-inductance.\\nBy Ohm\\'s law and ideal transformer identity:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZ\\n\\nL\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle Z_{\\\\text{L}}={\\\\frac {V_{\\\\text{S}}}{I_{\\\\text{S}}}}}\\n\\n  (Eq. 6)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZ\\n\\nL\\n\\n′\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\na\\n\\nV\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n/\\n\\na\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\na\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\nS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\na\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZ\\n\\nL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle Z\\'_{\\\\text{L}}={\\\\frac {V_{\\\\text{P}}}{I_{\\\\text{P}}}}={\\\\frac {aV_{\\\\text{S}}}{I_{\\\\text{S}}/a}}=a^{2}{\\\\frac {V_{\\\\text{S}}}{I_{\\\\text{S}}}}=a^{2}{Z_{\\\\text{L}}}}\\n\\n  (Eq. 7)\\nwhere \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZ\\n\\nL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle Z_{\\\\text{L}}}\\n\\n is the load impedance of the secondary circuit & \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZ\\n\\nL\\n\\n′\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle Z\\'_{\\\\text{L}}}\\n\\n is the apparent load or driving point impedance of the primary circuit, the superscript \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n′\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle \\'}\\n\\n denoting referred to the primary.\\n\\n\\nIdeal transformer[edit]\\nAn ideal transformer is linear, lossless and perfectly coupled.

This varying flux at the secondary winding induces a varying  electromotive force or voltage in the secondary winding. This electromagnetic induction phenomenon is the basis of transformer action and, in accordance with Lenz\\'s law, the secondary current so produced creates a flux equal and opposite to that produced by the primary winding.\\nThe windings are wound around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings. With a voltage source connected to the primary winding and a load connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions and the core magnetomotive force cancels to zero.\\nAccording to Faraday\\'s law, since the same magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings in an ideal transformer, a voltage is induced in each winding proportional to its number of turns. The transformer winding voltage ratio is equal to the winding turns ratio.[6]\\nAn ideal transformer is a reasonable approximation for a typical commercial transformer, with voltage ratio and winding turns ratio both being inversely proportional to the corresponding current ratio.\\nThe load impedance referred to the primary circuit is equal to the turns ratio squared times the secondary circuit load impedance.[7]\\n\\n\\nReal transformer[edit]\\nLeakage flux of a transformer\\nDeviations from ideal transformer[edit]\\nThe ideal transformer model neglects many basic linear aspects of real transformers, including unavoidable losses and inefficiencies.[8]\\n(a) Core losses, collectively called magnetizing current losses, consisting of[9]\\n\\nHysteresis losses due to nonlinear magnetic effects in the transformer core, and\\nEddy current losses due to joule heating in the core that are proportional to the square of the transformer\\'s applied voltage.\\n(b) Unlike the ideal model, the windings in a real transformer have non-zero resistances and inductances associated with:\\n\\nJoule losses due to resistance in the primary and secondary windings[9]\\nLeakage flux that escapes from the core and passes through one winding only resulting in primary and secondary reactive impedance.\\n(c) similar to an inductor, parasitic capacitance and self-resonance phenomenon due to the electric field distribution. Three kinds of parasitic capacitance are usually considered and the closed-loop equations are provided[10]\\n\\nCapacitance between adjacent turns in any one layer;\\nCapacitance between adjacent layers;\\nCapacitance between the core and the layer(s) adjacent to the core;\\nInclusion of capacitance into the transformer model is complicated, and is rarely attempted; the \\'real\\' transformer model\\'s equivalent circuit shown below does not include parasitic capacitance. However, the capacitance effect can be measured by comparing open-circuit inductance, i.e. the inductance of a primary winding when the secondary circuit is open, to a short-circuit inductance when the secondary winding is shorted.\\n\\nLeakage flux[edit]\\nMain article: Leakage inductance\\nThe ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.[11] Such flux is termed leakage flux, and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings.[12] Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.[11] Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\\nIn some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the short-circuit current it will supply.[12] Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit negative resistance, such as electric arcs, mercury- and sodium- vapor lamps and neon signs or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as electric arc welders.[9]:\\u200a485\\u200a\\nAir gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.[13] A saturable reactor exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\\nKnowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the percent impedance[e] and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (X/R) ratio of two transformers were\\nthe same, the transformers would share the load power in proportion to their respective ratings.  However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary.[15]\\n\\n\\nEquivalent circuit[edit]\\nSee also: Steinmetz equivalent circuit\\nReferring to the diagram, a practical transformer\\'s physical behavior may be represented by an equivalent circuit model, which can incorporate an ideal transformer.[16]\\nWinding joule losses and leakage reactance are represented by the following series loop impedances of the model:\\n\\nPrimary winding: RP, XP\\nSecondary winding: RS, XS.\\nIn normal course of circuit equivalence transformation, RS and XS are in practice usually referred to the primary side by multiplying these impedances by the turns ratio squared, (NP/NS)\\xa02\\xa0=\\xa0a2.\\n\\n\\nReal transformer equivalent circuit\\nCore loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model:\\n\\nCore or iron losses: RC\\nMagnetizing reactance: XM.\\nRC and XM are collectively termed the magnetizing branch of the model.\\nCore losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency.[9]:\\u200a142–143\\u200a The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current IM to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits.[9]:\\u200a142\\u200a With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by\\xa090°. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current I0 equals transformer no-load current.[16]\\n\\nInstrument transformer, with polarity dot and X1 markings on low-voltage (\"LV\") side terminal\\nThe resulting model, though sometimes termed \\'exact\\' equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions, retains a number of approximations.[16] Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactance by simple summation as two series impedances.\\nTransformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: open-circuit test, short-circuit test, winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.\\n\\nTransformer EMF equation[edit]\\n\\nIf the flux in the core is purely sinusoidal, the relationship for either winding between its rms voltage Erms of the winding, and the supply frequency f, number of turns N, core cross-sectional area A in m2 and peak magnetic flux density Bpeak in Wb/m2 or T (tesla) is given by the universal EMF equation:[9]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nE\\n\\nrms\\n\\n\\n=\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\nπ\\nf\\nN\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\npeak\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\n\\n≈\\n4.44\\nf\\nN\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\npeak\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle E_{\\\\text{rms}}={\\\\frac {2\\\\pi fNAB_{\\\\text{peak}}}{\\\\sqrt {2}}}\\\\approx 4.44fNAB_{\\\\text{peak}}}\\n\\n\\nPolarity[edit]\\nA dot convention is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings. Positively increasing instantaneous current entering the primary winding\\'s \\'dot\\' end induces positive polarity voltage exiting the secondary winding\\'s \\'dot\\' end. Three-phase transformers used in electric power systems will have a nameplate that indicate the phase relationships between their terminals. This may be in the form of a phasor diagram, or using an alpha-numeric code to show the type of internal connection (wye or delta) for each winding.\\n\\nEffect of frequency[edit]\\nThe EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.[9] By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400\\xa0Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.[17] Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7\\xa0Hz and 25\\xa0Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50–60\\xa0Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\\n\\nPower transformer overexcitation condition caused by decreased frequency; flux (green), iron core\\'s magnetic characteristics (red) and magnetizing current (blue).\\nOperation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require protective relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\\nOne example is in traction transformers used for electric multiple unit and high-speed train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50\\xa0Hz down to 16.7\\xa0Hz and rated up to 25\\xa0kV).\\nAt much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made switch-mode power supplies viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\\nTransformers for higher frequency applications such as SMPS typically use core materials with much lower hysteresis and eddy-current losses than those for 50/60\\xa0Hz. Primary examples are iron-powder and ferrite cores. The lower frequency-dependant losses of these cores often is at the expense of flux density at saturation. For instance, ferrite saturation occurs at a substantially lower flux density than laminated iron.\\nLarge power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.\\n\\nEnergy losses[edit]\\nTransformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses. Transformers\\' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity.[18] The efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent.[18][19]\\nAs transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on. Hysteresis and eddy current losses are constant at all load levels and dominate at no load, while winding loss increases as load increases. The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing energy efficient transformers for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality silicon steel, or even amorphous steel for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost. The choice of construction represents a trade-off between initial cost and operating cost.[20]\\nTransformer losses arise from:\\n\\nWinding joule losses\\nCurrent flowing through a winding\\'s conductor causes joule heating due to the resistance of the wire. As frequency increases, skin effect and proximity effect causes the winding\\'s resistance and, hence, losses to increase.\\nCore losses\\n\\nHysteresis losses\\nEach time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core, caused by motion of the magnetic domains within the steel. According to Steinmetz\\'s formula, the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\nh\\n\\n\\n≈\\nη\\n\\nβ\\n\\nmax\\n\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle W_{\\\\text{h}}\\\\approx \\\\eta \\\\beta _{\\\\text{max}}^{1.6}}\\n\\n and,\\nhysteresis loss is thus given by\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nP\\n\\nh\\n\\n\\n≈\\n\\n\\nW\\n\\n\\nh\\n\\n\\nf\\n≈\\nη\\n\\nf\\n\\n\\nβ\\n\\nmax\\n\\n\\n1.6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle P_{\\\\text{h}}\\\\approx {W}_{\\\\text{h}}f\\\\approx \\\\eta {f}\\\\beta _{\\\\text{max}}^{1.6}}\\n\\n\\nwhere, f is the frequency, η is the hysteresis coefficient and βmax is the maximum flux density, the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1.4 to 1.8 but is often given as 1.6 for iron.[20] For more detailed analysis, see Magnetic core and Steinmetz\\'s equation.\\nEddy current losses\\nEddy currents are induced in the conductive metal transformer core by the changing magnetic field, and this current flowing through the resistance of the iron dissipates energy as heat in the core. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.[20] Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of laminations (thin plates) electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.\\nMagnetostriction related transformer hum\\nMagnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction, the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as mains hum or \"transformer hum\".[21] This transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at power frequencies and in high-frequency flyback transformers associated with television CRTs.\\n Stray losses\\nLeakage inductance is by itself largely lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer\\'s support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat.[22]\\nRadiative\\nThere are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field but these are usually small.\\nMechanical vibration and audible noise transmission\\nIn addition to magnetostriction, the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. This energy incites vibration transmission in interconnected metalwork, thus amplifying audible transformer hum.[23]\\nConstruction[edit]\\nCores[edit]\\nCore form = core type; shell form = shell type\\nClosed-core transformers are constructed in \\'core form\\' or \\'shell form\\'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings are surrounded by the core, the transformer is shell form.[24] Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils.[24] Core form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230\\xa0kV or 75\\xa0MVA). At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent.[24][25][26] Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.[26]\\n\\nLaminated steel cores[edit]\\nShell type transformer with laminated core showing edges of laminations at the top of the photo\\nInterleaved E-I transformer laminations showing air gap and flux paths\\nTransformers for use at power or audio frequencies typically have cores made of high permeability silicon steel.[27] The steel has a permeability many times that of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.[28] Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires.[29] Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use. Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.[30] The transformer universal EMF equation can be used to calculate the core cross-sectional area for a preferred level of magnetic flux.[9]\\nThe effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude. Thinner laminations reduce losses,[27] but are more laborious and expensive to construct.[31] Thin laminations are generally used on high-frequency transformers, with some of very thin steel laminations able to operate up to 10\\xa0kHz.\\n\\nLaminating the core greatly reduces eddy-current losses\\nOne common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of E-shaped steel sheets capped with I-shaped pieces, leading to its name of E-I transformer.[31] Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.[31] They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.\\nA steel core\\'s remanence means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high inrush current until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform.[32] Overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass.\\nOn transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced currents due to geomagnetic disturbances during solar storms can cause saturation of the core and operation of transformer protection devices.[33]\\nDistribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy. The higher initial cost of the core material is offset over the life of the transformer by its lower losses at light load.[34]\\n\\nSolid cores[edit]\\nPowdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical resistivity. For frequencies extending beyond the VHF band, cores made from non-conductive magnetic ceramic materials called ferrites are common.[31] Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called \\'slugs\\') which allow adjustment of the coupling coefficient (and bandwidth) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.\\n\\nToroidal cores[edit]\\nSmall toroidal core transformer\\nToroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of silicon steel or permalloy wound into a coil, powdered iron, or ferrite.[35] A strip construction ensures that the grain boundaries are optimally aligned, improving the transformer\\'s efficiency by reducing the core\\'s reluctance. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.[9] :\\u200a485\\u200a The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core\\'s magnetic field from generating electromagnetic interference.\\nToroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see Classification parameters below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\\nFerrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10\\xa0kVA, and practically none above 25\\xa0kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.[36]\\n\\nAir cores[edit]\\nA transformer can be produced by placing the windings near each other, an arrangement termed an \"air-core\" transformer. An air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.[12] The magnetizing inductance is drastically reduced by the lack of a magnetic core, resulting in large magnetizing currents and losses if used at low frequencies. Air-core transformers are unsuitable for use in power distribution,[12] but are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications.[37] Air cores are also used for resonant transformers such as Tesla coils, where they can achieve reasonably low loss despite the low magnetizing inductance.\\n\\nWindings[edit]\\nWindings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.\\nCut view through transformer windings. Legend:  White: Air, liquid or other insulating medium  Green spiral: Grain oriented silicon steel Black: Primary winding  Red: Secondary winding \\nThe electrical conductor used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn. For small transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from enamelled magnet wire. Larger power transformers may be wound with copper rectangular strip conductors insulated by oil-impregnated paper and blocks of pressboard.[38]\\nHigh-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided Litz wire to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.[39] Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.[38] Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.[38]\\nThe windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.\\nPower-frequency transformers may have taps at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load tap changers are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as arc furnace transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A center-tapped transformer is often used in the output stage of an audio power amplifier in a push-pull circuit. Modulation transformers in AM transmitters are very similar.\\n\\nCooling[edit]\\nCutaway view of liquid-immersed transformer. The conservator (reservoir) at top provides liquid-to-atmosphere isolation as coolant level and temperature changes. The walls and fins provide required heat dissipation.\\nIt is a rule of thumb that the life expectancy of electrical insulation is halved for about every 7\\xa0°C to 10\\xa0°C increase in operating temperature (an instance of the application of the Arrhenius equation).[40]\\nSmall dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers are often self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these.[41] Large transformers are filled with transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings.[42] Transformer oil is often a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that the average age of failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures.[43][44] Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure.[40] With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information.\\nBuilding regulations in many jurisdictions require indoor liquid-filled transformers to either use dielectric fluids that are less flammable than oil, or be installed in fire-resistant rooms.[18] Air-cooled dry transformers can be more economical where they eliminate the cost of a fire-resistant transformer room.\\nThe tank of liquid-filled transformers often has radiators through which the liquid coolant circulates by natural convection or fins. Some large transformers employ electric fans for forced-air cooling, pumps for forced-liquid cooling, or have heat exchangers for water-cooling.[42] An oil-immersed transformer may be equipped with a Buchholz relay, which, depending on severity of gas accumulation due to internal arcing, is used to either trigger an alarm or de-energize the transformer.[32] Oil-immersed transformer installations usually include fire protection measures such as walls, oil containment, and fire-suppression sprinkler systems.\\nPolychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have properties that once favored their use as a dielectric coolant, though concerns over their environmental persistence led to a widespread ban on their use.[45]\\nToday, non-toxic, stable silicone-based oils, or fluorinated hydrocarbons may be used where the expense of a fire-resistant liquid offsets additional building cost for a transformer vault.[18][46] However, the long life span of transformers can mean that the potential for exposure can be high long after banning.[47]\\nSome transformers are gas-insulated.  Their windings are enclosed in sealed, pressurized tanks and often cooled by nitrogen or sulfur hexafluoride gas.[46]\\nExperimental power transformers in the 500–1,000\\xa0kVA range have been built with liquid nitrogen or helium cooled superconducting windings, which eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses.[48][49]\\n\\nInsulation[edit]\\nSubstation transformer undergoing testing.\\nInsulation must be provided between the individual turns of the windings, between the windings, between windings and core, and at the terminals of the winding.\\nInter-turn insulation of small transformers may be a layer of insulating varnish on the wire. Layer of paper or polymer films may be inserted between layers of windings, and between primary and secondary windings. A transformer may be coated or dipped in a polymer resin to improve the strength of windings and protect them from moisture or corrosion. The resin may be impregnated into the winding insulation using combinations of vacuum and pressure during the coating process, eliminating all air voids in the winding. In the limit, the entire coil may be placed in a mold, and resin cast around it as a solid block, encapsulating the windings.[50]\\nLarge oil-filled power transformers use windings wrapped with insulating paper, which is impregnated with oil during assembly of the transformer. Oil-filled transformers use highly refined mineral oil to insulate and cool the windings and core. \\nConstruction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, by circulating externally heated transformer oil, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core. For small transformers, resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used.\\n\\nBushings[edit]\\nLarger transformers are provided with high-voltage insulated bushings made of polymers or porcelain. A large bushing can be a complex structure since it must provide careful control of the electric field gradient without letting the transformer leak oil.[51]\\n\\nClassification parameters[edit]\\nAn electrical substation in Melbourne, Australia showing three of five 220\\xa0kV – 66\\xa0kV transformers, each with a capacity of 150\\xa0MVA\\nCamouflaged transformer in Langley City, Canada\\nTransformers can be classified in many ways, such as the following:\\n\\nPower rating: From a fraction of a volt-ampere (VA) to over a thousand MVA.\\nDuty of a transformer: Continuous, short-time, intermittent, periodic, varying.\\nFrequency range: Power-frequency, audio-frequency, or radio-frequency.\\nVoltage class: From a few volts to hundreds of kilovolts.\\nCooling type: Dry or liquid-immersed;  self-cooled, forced air-cooled;forced oil-cooled, water-cooled.\\nApplication:  power supply, impedance matching, output voltage and current stabilizer, pulse, circuit isolation,  power distribution, rectifier, arc furnace, amplifier output, etc..\\nBasic magnetic form: Core form, shell form, concentric, sandwich.\\nConstant-potential transformer descriptor:  Step-up,  step-down, isolation.\\nGeneral winding configuration: By IEC vector group, two-winding combinations of the phase designations  delta, wye or star, and zigzag; autotransformer, Scott-T\\nRectifier phase-shift winding configuration: 2-winding, 6-pulse; 3-winding, 12-pulse; . . ., n-winding, [n\\xa0−\\xa01]·6-pulse; polygon; etc..\\n\\nApplications[edit]\\nTransformer at the Limestone Generating Station in Manitoba, Canada\\nMain article: Transformer types\\nVarious specific electrical application designs require a variety of transformer types. Although they all share the basic characteristic transformer principles, they are customized in construction or electrical properties for certain installation requirements or circuit conditions.\\nIn electric power transmission, transformers allow transmission of electric power at high voltages, which reduces the loss due to heating of the wires. This allows generating plants to be located economically at a distance from electrical consumers.[52] All but a tiny fraction of the world\\'s electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.[22]\\nIn many electronic devices, a transformer is used to convert voltage from the distribution wiring to convenient values for the circuit requirements, either directly at the power line frequency or through a switch mode power supply.\\nSignal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of amplifiers and to match devices such as microphones and record players to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed telephone circuits to carry on a two-way conversation over a single pair of wires. A balun transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has balanced voltages to ground, such as between external cables and internal circuits. Isolation transformers prevent leakage of current into the secondary circuit and are used in medical equipment and at construction sites. Resonant transformers are used for coupling between stages of radio receivers, or in high-voltage Tesla coils.\\n\\n\\nSchematic of a large oil-filled power transformer 1. Tank 2. Lid 3.

Nicholas Callan of Maynooth College, Ireland in 1836.[57] He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists\\' and inventors\\' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce direct current (DC) rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.\\n\\nFirst alternating current transformers[edit]\\nBy the 1870s, efficient generators producing alternating current (AC) were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an interrupter.\\nIn 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several \\'electric candles\\' (arc lamps) of his own design. The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.[60]\\nIn 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.[57][61]\\nIn 1882, Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs first exhibited a device with an initially widely criticized laminated plate open iron core called a \\'secondary generator\\' in London, then sold the idea to the Westinghouse company in the United States in 1886.[29] They also exhibited the invention in Turin, Italy in 1884, where it was highly successful and adopted for an electric lighting system.[62] Their device used a fixed 1:1 ratio to supply a series circuit for the utilization load (lamps). The voltage of their system was controlled by pushing in and pulling out its open iron core.[63]\\n\\nEarly series circuit transformer distribution[edit]\\nInduction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.[62]\\nEfficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the war of the currents, and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.[64]\\n\\nShell form transformer. Sketch used by Uppenborn to describe ZBD engineers\\' 1885 patents and earliest articles.[62]\\nCore form, front; shell form, back. Earliest specimens of ZBD-designed high-efficiency constant-potential transformers manufactured at the Ganz factory in 1885.\\nThe ZBD team consisted of Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri\\nStanley\\'s 1886 design for adjustable gap open-core induction coils\\nClosed-core transformers and parallel power distribution[edit]\\nIn the autumn of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three Hungarian engineers associated with the Ganz Works, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.[61] The Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world\\'s first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884.[65] This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40\\xa0Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.[65] In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either wound around an iron wire ring core or surrounded by an iron wire core.[62] The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, termed \"core form\" or \"shell form\" .[66]\\nIn both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see Toroidal cores below). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.[67] The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred).[68][69] When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. Bláthy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments;[70] In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores.[71]\\nTransformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers. They also popularized the word \\'transformer\\' to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current[72] although the term had already been in use by 1882.[73][74] In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world\\'s first power station that used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.[75]\\n\\nWestinghouse improvements[edit]\\nE-shaped plates for transformer cores developed by Westinghouse\\nBuilding on the advancement of AC technology in Europe,[76] George Westinghouse founded the Westinghouse Electric in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on January 8, 1886.[77] The new firm became active in developing alternating current (AC) electric infrastructure throughout the United States.  \\nThe Edison Electric Light Company held an option on the US rights for the ZBD transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles. George Westinghouse had bought Gaulard and Gibbs\\' patents for $50,000 in February 1886.[78] He assigned to William Stanley the task of redesign the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer for commercial use in United States.[79] Stanley\\'s first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the EMF present in the secondary winding (see image). This design[80] was first used commercially in the US in 1886[81] but Westinghouse was intent on improving the Stanley design to make it (unlike the ZBD type) easy and cheap to produce.[80]\\nWestinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed a core that was easier to manufacture, consisting of a stack of thin \\'E‑shaped\\' iron plates insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Pre-wound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse obtained a patent for the new low-cost design in 1887.[70]\\n\\nOther early transformer designs[edit]\\nIn 1889, Russian-born engineer Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed the first three-phase transformer at the Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (\\'General Electricity Company\\') in Germany.[82]\\nIn 1891, Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil, an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for producing very high voltages at high frequency.[83]\\nAudio frequency transformers (\"repeating coils\") were used by early experimenters in the development of the telephone.[84]\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\n\\nHigh-voltage transformer fire barriers\\nInductive coupling\\nLoad profile\\nMagnetization\\nParametric transformer\\nPolyphase system\\nPower inverter\\nRectiformer\\nVoltage converter\\n\\nNotes[edit]\\n\\n\\n^ With turns of the winding oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines, the flux is the product of the magnetic flux density and the core area, the magnetic field varying with time according to the excitation of the primary.

Introduction \\nMobile devices, smartphones and tablet computers in particular, have generated a lot of \\ninterest among researchers in recent years (Byrne & Diem, 2014). This is because the \\nopportunities these new technologies may offer (e.g. individualized learning, the variety \\nof mobile apps available, easy access to the internet) and/or the fact that they are \\nincreasingly more common among learners make them an important and potentially \\nuseful addition to formal and informal language learning. \\nAccording to Benson (2011), there has always been a connection between educational \\ntechnologies and learner autonomy to the extent that they have often been intended for \\nindependent practice. It should be noted, however, that this link and “future enquiry \\nand practice into technology-mediated learner autonomy will need to be increasingly \\naligned to the tools, settings, and activities that are of significance to language learners” \\n(Reinders & White, 2016, p. 151). Reinders and White (2016) further argue that as long \\nas “the potential range of settings, tools, and experiences is now virtually limitless, \\nindividuals need to be increasingly adept at critical adaptive learning in order to benefit \\nfrom and contribute effectively to those settings” (p. 151). Beyond doubt, contemporary \\nlanguage teachers should equip foreign/second language learners with appropriate \\nknowledge concerning the affordances of mobile devices for language study and they \\nshould prepare them for effective usage of such devices for this purpose. It is also of \\nparamount importance, for both researchers and practitioners, to comprehend the link \\nbetween the modalities of the language learners' organization of their own learning \\nexperiences and environments and the role mobile technologies, in particular \\nsmartphones and tablets, play in these contexts. \\nTaking into consideration the above-mentioned issues, the study reported in this article \\ninvestigated ways advanced English language students use their mobile devices (i.e. \\nsmartphones and tablet computers) for their language learning.

This is followed by the presentation of the results of the study. The article \\ncloses with discussion and conclusions. \\n2. Literature review \\n2.1. Autonomy in foreign/second language learning \\nThe concept of autonomy in second/foreign language learning and teaching has been \\nthe focus of attention for many researchers and practitioners for more than three \\ndecades. According to Benson (2001), the notion of autonomy was introduced and \\npopularized in 1981 by Henri Holec in his seminal report for the Council of Europe \\nentitled Autonomy in Foreign Language Learning in which the researcher defined \\nautonomy in the context of language learning as “the ability to take charge of one’s own \\nlearning” (Holec, 1981, p. 3). Holec’s idea of autonomy encompasses some components \\nand capacities on the part of language learners (e.g. self-directed learning). For some \\nother authors autonomy also involves “a capacity – for detachment, critical reflection, \\ndecision-making, and independent action” (Little, 1991, p. 4) and “the capacity to take \\ncontrol of one’s own learning” (Benson, 2001, p. 46). As stated by Benson (2011, p. \\n16), “autonomy is multidimensional and takes many different forms according to the \\nperson, the setting, and multiple contextual and micro-contextual factors” and it is “a \\nmulti-faceted concept that consists of several layers” (Reinders, 2011, p. 48) whose \\nroots are based in political, societal and educational developments. In addition to this, \\nwork on autonomy emphasizes social dimensions of learner autonomy in view of the \\nfact that “autonomous learners always do things for themselves, but they may or may \\nnot do things on their own” (Little, 2009, p. 223) and that by means of social \\ninteractions language learners “develop a capacity to analyze, reflect upon and \\nsynthesize information to create new perspectives” (Lee, 2011, p. 88). It should also be \\nnoted that recent research shows that fostering autonomy is no longer predominantly a \\nmatter of individualizing learning through out-of-class initiatives since the dominance of \\nclassroom-based approaches (Benson, 2011). Finally, it has to be added that \\nresearchers, in general, seem to be in agreement with the following claims suggested \\nby Benson (2011): “(a) language learners naturally tend to take control of their \\nlearning, (b) learners who lack autonomy are capable of developing it, and (c) \\nautonomous language learning is more effective than non-autonomous language \\nlearning” (p. 16). \\nPerhaps in order to define the concept of autonomy in language learning it is necessary \\nto understand who autonomous learners are. As Littlewood (1996) claims, an \\nautonomous learner is “one who has independent capacity to make and carry out \\nchoices which govern his or her actions” (p. 428). The researcher argues that this \\ncapacity depends on two major components such as ability and willingness, and he \\nclaims that the attributes can also be further subdivided. Thus, ability depends on \\nhaving knowledge about the options from which one can choose and skills so as to \\nchoose the most suitable alternatives. When it comes to willingness, this depends on \\nhaving motivation and confidence in order to take responsibility for adequate choices. \\nMoreover, Littlewood (1996) argues that if an individual is to be successful in being \\nautonomous, all of these components have to be present all together. \\nAt the close of this section, a few words are in order on the notion of autonomous \\nlanguage learning. An interesting description of the concept in question is offered by \\nReinders (2011), who defines autonomous language learning as “an act of learning \\nwhereby motivated learners consciously make informed decisions about that learning” \\n(p. 48). According to the said researcher, it is not possible or needed in all acts of \\nlearning to be able or ready to intentionally make decisions since different learning \\nsituations present different demands. Reinders (2011) further argues that “autonomy is \\nnot an either-or concept, but has to be seen as a continuum” (p. 48). This is because a \\nlearner can display more or less autonomy in different learning circumstances. \\nAutonomy, in Reinders’ terms changes over time between skills and within skills and \\nthus it is difficult to achieve and is not invariably permanent (Reinders, 2011). \\n \\n \\n'),\n",

Autonomy and new technologies \\nAs stated in the previous section, the concept of autonomy has been one of the most \\nresearched areas in the field of second/foreign language learning and teaching over the \\nlast few decades. It should be noted, however, that the field of learner autonomy \\nstarted to be influenced by technology in the mid-1990s as a result of the growing \\ninfluence of the internet on almost every sphere of our life (including second/foreign \\nlanguage education) and the opportunities for online collaboration and communication \\n(Reinders & White, 2016). As stated by Benson and Chik (2010), the latest generations \\nof new technologies, particularly those encompassing the internet, user-generated Web \\ncontent and mobility, seem to be having a bearing on the way autonomous language \\nlearning develops. Perhaps, one of the most important benefits of implementing new \\ntechnologies into language learning is the fact that they provide occasions for language \\nlearners who do not have direct access to the target language. This is because the use \\nof new technologies, including mobile technology, allow them to “bypass classrooms and \\ngo directly to target language texts and users through the internet and social media” \\n(Benson, 2011, p. 17). \\nWhen it comes to the use of mobile technology, and, in particular, smartphones and \\ntablet computers, for learning a foreign or second language, they can assist language \\nlearners with their learning endeavors by granting access to numerous language \\nresources whenever and wherever such learners need them and/or they happen to be \\n(Jones, 2015). In Jones’s opinion, such language involvement might comprise, for \\ninstance, the use of chunks of spare time for language practice, searching for target \\nlanguage vocabulary in relevant contexts or interactions on social media (Jones, 2015). \\nFurthermore, by having a mobile device a language learner has the opportunity to take \\ncontrol of his or her learning, direct it and engage in language activities that meet his or \\nher individual needs and goals (Kukulska-Hulme, Traxler & Pettit, 2007; Pettit & \\nKukulska-Hulme 2007). \\nGiven the importance attached to new technologies, and, in particular the potential role \\nof \\nmobile \\ndevices \\nin \\nautonomous \\nlanguage \\nlearning, \\nthe \\nterms mobile \\nlearning and mobile devices (MobDs) need first to be explained. As for mobile learning, \\nno single agreed-upon definition of the term exists in the literature (Oz, 2015). This is \\nbecause some researchers define mobile learning as an extension of e-learning built \\nupon mobile devices whereas some other researchers understand  it as learning that \\nhappens anywhere and anytime (cf. Oz, 2015). As far as mobile devices are concerned, \\nthey can be defined as “any device that is small, autonomous and unobtrusive enough \\nto accompany us in every moment and can be used for educational purposes” \\n(Trifanova Knapp, Ronchetti & Gamper, 2004, p. 3) or as “hand held electronic devices \\nthat can be comfortably carried around in a pocket or bag, including MP3 players, digital \\nrecorders, e-readers, tablets, and smartphones” (Kukulska-Hulme, Norris & Donohue, \\n2015, p. 39). \\nA lot of studies concerning the use of mobile technology and mobile devices in language \\nlearning have been published. The findings of these studies concentrated on, for \\nexample, language learners’ views on the use of mobile devices in language instruction \\n(e.g. Oz, 2015), students’ attitudes towards using mobile phones as instructional tools \\nfor foreign language learning (e.g. Cakir, 2015), profiling mobile language learners (e.g. \\nByrne & Diem, 2014), their effect on learning a foreign/second language (e.g. Nah, \\nWhite & Sussex, 2008; Cavus & Ibrahim, 2009; Zhang, Song & Burston, 2011), \\ndistance language learning (e.g. Demouy, Jones, Kan, Kukulska-Hulme & Eardley, \\n2016), informal language learning practices (Reinders & Cho, 2011; Jones, 2015), \\nlearners’ use of mobile devices for learning a foreign language (Stockwell, 2007; \\nDashtestani, 2015) and autonomy in language learning (e.g. Díaz-Vera, 2012; Djoub, \\n2015). In addition to this, researchers investigated a number of applications of mobile \\ndevices and presented both benefits and drawbacks of the usage of mobile technologies \\n(e.g. Miangah & Nezarat, 2012), discussed the use of mobile devices in supporting \\nsocial contacts and collaborative learning (e.g. Kukulska-Hulme & Shield, 2008) and \\noffered guidelines related to the implementation of mobile learning into second/foreign \\nlanguage instruction (e.g. Kukulska-Hulme et al., 2015). \\n \\n \\n'),\n",

Method \\n3.1. Research question \\nOne of the questions related to future research and practice in technology-mediated \\nlearner autonomy addressed by Reinders and White in their recent critical overview of \\nthe relationship between technology and autonomy in the journal Language Learning & \\nTechnology (LLT) concerned language learners engagement with technology-mediated \\nenvironments in order to develop learning experiences that reach their aims and meet \\ntheir needs as language learners (Reinders & White, 2016). Taking this important \\nmatter into consideration, and in view of the fact that mobile technology, including \\nmobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, are ubiquitous and \\nsubstantial constituents of almost every language learner’s everyday life, the \\nabovementioned question was modified and posed in this study in the following way: \\nDo students engage with their mobile devices to develop learning experiences \\n(e.g. the use of mobile devices for formal and/or informal English language \\nstudy) that meet their needs and goals (e.g. the development of the target \\nlanguage skills and sub-skills) as English language learners? If yes, why and how \\ndo they do this? \\n3.2. Participants \\nThe participants were 20 Polish university students of English philology, nine of whom \\n(seven females and two males) were in the second year of their BA programme, six \\n(five females and one male) in the third year and five (all females) in the second year of \\ntheir MA program (1). The study participants were on average 22.22 years old (20.66 - \\nyear 2, BA; 21.82 - year 3, BA and 24.50 - year 2, MA). The subjects reported having \\nlearned English for an average of 11.38 years (10.49 - year 2, BA; 11.27 - year 3, BA \\nand 12.21 - year 2, MA). The proficiency level represented by the participants of the \\nstudy could be described as somewhere between B1 and B2 (second year BA students), \\nB2 and C1 (third year BA students) and C1 and C2 (second year MA students), as \\nspecified in the levels laid out in the Common European Framework of Reference for \\nLanguages. \\n3.3. Data collection and analysis \\nThe data were gathered by means of a semi-structured interview. This interview format \\nwas chosen intentionally since it uses a set of prepared in advance guiding questions \\nand prompts and interviewees are encouraged to elaborate on the problems raised \\nduring it (Dörnyei, 2007). As Dörnyei (2007) explains, in this type of the interview “the \\ninterviewer provides guidelines and direction (hence the ‘-structured’ part in the name), \\nbut is also keen to follow up interesting developments and to let the interviewee \\nelaborate on certain issues (hence the ‘semi-’ part)” (p. 136). \\nDuring the interview, the present researcher attempted to encourage the subjects to \\ndescribe their learning experiences concerning the use of mobile devices for English \\nstudy. This was a form of introspection where the students were prompted to examine \\ntheir behaviors and provide a first person narrative of such experiences. All the study \\nparticipants were informed that the interview concerned the use of mobile devices for \\nEnglish study and they were asked for permission to be digitally recorded. In order to \\nobtain relevant data the following questions were asked (2): \\n\\uf0b7 Do you use your mobile devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, MP3 players, \\nPDAs) for learning English? \\n\\uf0b7 Why do you use your mobile device(s) for learning English? \\n\\uf0b7 When did you start using your mobile device(s) for learning English? Has the \\nuse of your mobile device(s) increased or decreased since that time? \\n\\uf0b7 Do you use your mobile device(s) during classes? \\n\\uf0b7 Do you use your mobile device(s) more frequently in- or out-of-class English \\nlearning? \\n\\uf0b7 What mobile apps have you been using most frequently and/or recently? \\n\\uf0b7 Do you use your mobile device(s) more often in relation to formal or informal \\nEnglish language study? \\n'),\n",

The analysis \\nstarted with partial transcription of the important parts of the data (Dörnyei, 2007) on a \\ncomputer word processor program Microsoft Word 2016. Then the transcribed parts of \\nthe data were read several times in order to look for common themes and frequently \\noccurring information. The recurring ideas were coded and recoded, revised and \\nupdated. The researcher used the highlighting function of the word processor program \\nwhich allows the user to highlight the text on the transcript with different colors and \\ncomments to record any observations and thematic categories recognized in the data. \\nThe emerged categories were reviewed, compared, modified and either merged or \\nabandoned. It should also be noted that the obtained data were analyzed quantitatively. \\nThis type of analysis involved counting the number of the interviewees’ responses and \\ncalculating percentages. \\n4. Findings \\nA thorough analysis of the data yielded the following thematic categories: usage of \\nmobile devices, reasons for \\nusing mobile devices, resources and \\ntools, mobile \\nencounters, language practiced and study performance. \\n4.1. Usage of mobile devices \\nTable 1 shows the study participants’ mobile devices (MobDs) usage descriptions. The \\ntable demonstrates that smartphones were the most often used mobile devices by the \\nstudents. In addition, the numerical information in the table indicates that the \\nparticipants, on average, had been using them for English language study for about \\n3.80 years (minimum 2, maximum 6 years). 9 (45%) and 11 (55%) of the subjects \\nstarted using their mobile devices at senior high school and university, respectively. It \\nshould also be added that, with the exception of one student (i.e. S9), all the other \\nparticipants claimed to use their mobile devices in order to learn English much more \\nfrequently with time. Finally, more than half of the students (55%) regarded themselves \\nas experienced or fairly experienced users of their MobDs for English language learning; \\nhowever, 45% claimed not to be very skilful in this area. \\nTable 1.

Reasons for using mobile devices \\nThe study participants decided on the use of their MobDs in order to learn English for \\nthe reason that they regarded them as convenient, fast and always ready to use. In \\naddition, some students pointed to the fact that the use of MobDs allowed them to have \\nquick access to the internet and organize their own study materials and/or resources. \\nIllustrative examples of such opinions are provided below (3): \\nS10: It’s very comfortable. I can reach for my dictionary any time I want and I \\ndon’t have to carry thick books (...) The main aspect is convenience. \\nS5: It’s because I can find needed information ... it’s convenient because I \\nalways carry my smartphone and I have access to the internet all the time (...) \\nAt home I also use my smartphone and I don’t mind it has a small screen. \\nS14: My tablet lets me organize things and keep my documents in one place. \\nThis is because studying English means having countless study materials (...) I \\ncan store them there (...) this also gives me easier access to them (...) In \\naddition, my smartphone can successfully replace a traditional paper dictionary \\nand I don’t have to waste time in thumbing through a lot of pages to find words \\nI’m looking for. \\n4.3. Resources and tools \\nThe analysis of the data revealed that the students made use of both online resources \\nand mobile apps. The most frequently used language tools were online dictionaries \\n(e.g. diki, ColorDict Dictionary) and a variety of mobile apps, such as Google \\nTranslate, Duolingo and Fiszkoteka. The students usually accessed these tools in order \\nto check, revise and learn the target language vocabulary. Two students also reported \\nusing Voscreen and WhatsApp, i.e. mobile apps for watching video and communicating \\nwith people, respectively. It should also be noted that the interviewees pointed out \\nvarious online resources they used with the purpose of practicing reading and listening \\nskills \\n(e.g. TED, \\nonline \\nnewspapers, YouTube), \\nvocabulary \\n(e.g. 6 \\nMinute \\n'),\n",

Finally, some students used their MobDs in order to read language \\nmaterials downloaded from the internet (e.g. PDF files). The following responses \\nillustrate some of these issues: \\nS5: I use apps for “index cards”, dictionaries and a variety of apps for \\ndeveloping English vocabulary. \\nS10: I have some online friends and I talk with them in English (Do you do this \\nby means of instant messaging applications?) Yes, I use WhatsApp Messenger. \\nS15: I often read scanned book pages and pdf materials (…) I access English \\nvocabulary by means of online dictionaries. \\nS20: Fiszkoteka. I frequently use this app (...) I also listen to podcasts and I \\nhave the app called Six minutes English in order to practice listening (...) Also \\nbecause vocabulary is used in a variety of contexts. \\n4.4. Mobile encounters \\nThirteen (65%) interviewees claimed to use their MobDs most frequently in their leisure \\ntime, six (30%) in the classroom and one student said he had used his smartphone \\nequally frequently in the classroom and out-of-class English study. As for the students \\nwho used their smartphones or tablet computers in their leisure time, some of them did \\nit with the aim of reading English texts, listening to audio resources, checking and \\nlearning new vocabulary, preparing multimedia presentations and playing language \\ngames. This is not to say, of course, that this group of learners did not use their MobDs \\nat all during classes; however, the use of MobDs in this respect was only limited to \\nchecking target language vocabulary (e.g. S1: I use my smartphone, for example, to \\ncheck something I don’t understand (...) I installed a dictionary and I use it to find \\nwords). When it comes to the subjects who claimed to use their MobDs  most frequently \\nin the classroom, they used them to check unfamiliar vocabulary and/or find words they \\nneeded during various language activities. It is also important to note that these \\nstudents were not very willing to use their MobDs at home in view of the fact that they \\nfavored their home computers. For example: \\nS7: I use them outside of University in order to learn and practice English \\nvocabulary and to prepare multimedia presentations. \\nS13: In my free time I learn English words and phrases, listen to English \\nrecordings and I read various texts in English. \\nS19: Yes, I use my smartphone and tablet for out-of-class learning but I also \\nuse them during classes mostly to check words and collocations. \\nS16: I think I do this during practical English language classes more regularly in \\nthe classroom than outside of it (...) In the classroom I check English words in \\ndigital dictionaries (...) I do this to check words, spelling, or to recall some words \\n(...) or I use my smartphone to look for synonyms (...). \\nThe analysis of the gathered data also demonstrated that the majority of the \\ninterviewees (13 or 65%) were in favor of using their smartphones and/or tablet \\ncomputers for informal English learning (i.e. learning the target language for pleasure) \\nand 7 (35%) students associated the use of their MobDs with formal learning (i.e. \\nrelated to their studies). It should be noted, however, that only two interviewees \\nclaimed to hold and somewhat organize regular mobile English language sessions: \\nS10: I think this is what I have talked about earlier, I mean these chats with my \\nfriends. Perhaps we don’t chat very regularly ... we chat three times a week and \\nthat’s it but, at the same time, it’s not sporadic because we arrange it and it \\ntakes place pretty regularly. \\nS16: I often watch videos on YouTube and I do this the most often through my \\nsmartphone. \\nFinally, it has to be noted that the use of mobile devices was not explicitly advised or \\nsuggested by the interviewees’ teachers during their practical English language classes \\nor any other classes at the university. This is not to say, of course, that they never \\n'),\n",

Language practiced \\nWhen asked to indicate the most frequently practiced language skills and subsystems by \\nmeans of mobile devices, all the interviewees indicated the target language vocabulary. \\nIn addition to this, some referred to pronunciation and only a few students mentioned \\ngrammar and practicing reading, listening and speaking skills. As far as practicing \\nEnglish vocabulary is concerned, the subjects chose to practice it through their \\nsmartphones and/or tables because they regarded this language subsystem as the most \\nimportant to learn, they praised their MobDs for providing them with quick and easy \\naccess to needed words and see the way they were used in given sentences. As was \\nstressed by many of the interviewees, learning English vocabulary by means of mobile \\ndevices also allowed them to check correct pronunciation of words (i.e. they listened to \\nit or paid attention to phonetic transcription of words). The following excerpts exemplify \\nthe most typical usage of MobDs by the study participants: \\nS3: (…) as for vocabulary I guess it’s much faster to search for words and know \\nhow to use them in sentences. \\nS6: It’s easy and it’s very easy to look for words when I need them. \\nS12: (…) I need vocabulary not only to communicate in English (…) when I look \\nfor words I look at contexts words are used (...) I always pay attention to \\nspelling and also listen to pronunciation (How about phonetic transcription of \\nwords?) Phonetic transcription of words ... yes but not often unless audio is poor \\nquality or it seems to sound somehow differently ... then I make sure how a \\nword is pronounced and I read its phonetic transcription given there. \\nAs mentioned earlier, only a few students resorted to their MobDs in order to practice \\nother language areas such as listening, reading and speaking as well as grammar. This \\nis because they preferred more traditional resources (e.g. grammar books), they used \\nother devices (e.g. laptop computers) or they regarded themselves as quite proficient in \\nparticular language skills and thus they did not feel the need to master them by way of \\nMobDs. Representative excerpts from the interviewees’ responses follow: \\nS3: When it comes to grammar, for me it’s more convenient to use grammar \\nbooks to learn it. \\nS2: (…) I’m pretty good at English grammar and listening and I don’t have to \\nuse my smartphone to learn these language elements. \\nS12: I think I’m quite good at grammar and I practice listening skills by means \\nof my laptop computer. \\n4.6. Study performance \\nThere is evidence that the use of mobile devices became an impetus for studying \\nEnglish more and learn this language more effectively and efficiently (this advantageous \\neffect was expressed by as many as 15 or 75% interviewees). This is because  access to \\na smartphone or a tablet allows some learners  devote more time to learning English \\n(S1: Yes, I think so. I think I spend more time ... If I was to use traditional materials, \\nfor example, books, I wouldn’t devote so much time to it.; S15: It seems to me that I \\ndedicate more time to learn English this way and I learn more.), encouraged another \\nstudent to learn more (S6: I’m more willing to use my smartphone than open a paper \\ndictionary.) and allowed yet another subject to learn more vocabulary (S12: Yes, \\ndefinitely. I wouldn’t have learned these words if I hadn’t used my phone.). Such \\nbeneficial outcomes of the use of MobDs are best described by one of the interviewees \\nwho said: \\nIf I’m to say that I devote more time for learning English it’s because I can \\ndevote more time to learning it ... in the way I compare a paper dictionary with \\nan online one ... for example to check one word ... If I use a traditional \\ndictionary it takes me longer, say three minutes, but If I use an online dictionary \\nit takes me, say, ten seconds (...) this way I can devote less time to looking for \\n'),\n",

(S14) \\nIt is also interesting to note that the use of mobile devices might be valuable for \\nkinesthetic or tactical language learners: \\nI think I spend more time … for me it’s much nicer and more interesting than \\nsitting and reading books … it’s better for me since I’m kinesthetic so it’s hard \\nfor me to sit and read a traditional book ... it’s because I don’t remember then \\nmuch but when I use my smartphone which is mobile I can ...

Discussion and conclusions \\nThe picture that emerges from the analysis of the collected data regarding the advanced \\nlearners' use of mobile devices for learning English is relatively encouraging. This is \\nbecause all the study participants used, at least to some extent, their mobile devices \\n(i.e. smartphones and/or tablet computers) in order to learn the English language \\nautonomously. Moreover, the positive impact of using mobile devices for English study \\nwas acknowledged by the majority of the interviewees. Their beneficial contribution to \\ntheir English development was chiefly linked with easy access to English language \\nresources, the opportunity to store them, comfort in using their smartphones and \\ntablets anywhere and anytime as well as perceived gains in English learning. The results \\nof the study also showed that all interviewees engaged with their smartphones and/or \\ntablet computers to practice the target language vocabulary (plus some students also \\nclaimed to learn pronunciation of English words) and the majority of the subjects used \\ntheir mobile devices autonomously in their leisure time as well as during language \\nclasses. Such a state of affairs can be explained in terms of increased awareness on the \\npart of some students of the beneficial role of MobDs in foreign language learning, their \\nability to reach for appropriate tools and retrieve needed information to achieve their \\ngoals and adjust their learning of the target language to their personal learning styles. \\nDespite this positive view of MobDs reported by the study participants, the results of the \\nstudy also revealed that only a few subjects engaged with their mobile devices to \\nmaster target language skills such as reading, listening, writing and speaking as well as \\nEnglish language grammar. In addition, some interviewees limited themselves to a \\nrather intuitive and perhaps even spontaneous use of their mobile devices in the \\nlanguage classroom. It should also be noted that almost half of the subjects regarded \\nthemselves as quite inexperienced in using their mobile devices when it comes to \\nlearning the English language despite the fact that some of the students had been using \\nthem with the intention of learning English for years. Taking all these findings into \\naccount, one may conclude that this is due to a failure or underestimation of the role \\nand place of mobile devices in foreign language learning and teaching on the part of \\nlanguage teachers. It seems therefore warranted to say that the subjects’ use of mobile \\ndevices could be altered if teachers took into account the benefits they may offer. For \\nthis reason language teachers should, for instance, present the affordances of mobile \\ntechnology and discuss them with students during language classes. They should also \\nselect mobile apps and create opportunities for using them in- and out-of-class learning \\nby offering or designing tasks devoted to practicing a variety of language skills and \\nsubsystems suitable for the use of such devices. If this were to happen, teachers need \\nto respond quickly to the constant and dynamic changes in contemporary \\nforeign/second language learning and teaching contexts by undergoing official teacher \\ntraining not only in the area of technology-mediated language learning and teaching but \\nalso in the context of learner autonomy. \\nAs with all studies, the study reported in this paper has some limitations. Although the \\ninterviewees represented a range of experience of English language learning, the small \\nnumber of participants reduces the generalizability of the results. Another limitation is \\nrelated to the fact that the group was largely homogenous, i.e. the subjects came from \\nthe same institution and all studied English. Yet another weakness may concern the \\n\"),\n",

It can be accelerated and directed by electromagnetic ﬁelds which\\nmake it to be controlled and employed. The matter in inner-stellar space is\\ncomposed of plasma. The general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)\\nis the standard theory which is helpful to explore the dynamics of falling\\nmagnetized plasma towards the event horizon.\\nAn accretion disk is formed near the Schwarzschild black hole as plasma\\nﬂows towards it. Perturbations in black hole regime have always been fas-\\ncinated the researchers.\\nRegge and Wheeler [1] discussed the stability of\\nSchwarzschild singularity. Price [2] examined the dynamics of non-spherical\\nperturbations during the collapse of stars with a scalar-ﬁeld analog. Waves\\nin an electron-positron plasma were investigated by Sakai and Kawata [3] in\\na frame of two-ﬂuid equation for the Schwarzschild black hole. Southwood\\n[4] used a small perturbation approach to derive the general stability criteria\\nfor plasma with isotropic pressure.\\nGleiser et al. [5] studied even parity\\nperturbation of the Schwarzschild black hole up to second order.\\nArnowitt, Deser and Misner (ADM) [6] developed 3+1 formalism in which\\nspacetime is foliated into layers of three-dimensional spacelike hypersurface,\\nthreaded by a timelike normal. Many relativists [7]-[8] applied this technique\\nto illustrate diﬀerent attributes of general relativity. Thorne and Macdonald\\n[9]-[10] evolved the electromagnetic ﬁelds of the black hole theory. Holcomb\\nand Tajima [11], Holcomb [12] and Dettmann et al. [13] analyzed the pro-\\nduction of waves in the Friedmann universe.\\nBuzzi et al.\\n[14] examined\\nthe wave properties of two ﬂuid plasma in the surroundings of Schwarzschild\\nevent horizon.\\nZhang [15] explicated the theory of stationary symmetric\\nGRMHD in black hole regime. The same author [16] also studied the behav-\\nior of perturbation of cold plasma in the magnetosphere of Kerr black hole.\\nSharif and his collaborators [17]-[20] determined the plasma wave properties\\nby using dispersion relations. They analyzed it for cold, isothermal and hot\\nplasmas.\\nVeselago medium or Double negative medium (DNG) is the most famous\\nclass of metamaterials. This medium has simultaneously negative electric\\npermittivity and magnetic permeability. Negative phase velocity (NPV) and\\nnegative refractive index are main features of this medium. Ziolkowski [21]\\nanalyzed electromagnetic wave properties in DNG. Valanju et al. [22] estab-\\nlished the well-known idea that wave refraction in DNG medium is always\\npositive but not homogenous. Ross et al. [23] found that NPV propaga-\\ntion develops at lower values of cosmological constant Λ in the vicinity of\\nnon-rotating black hole. Mackey and Lakhtakia [24] veriﬁed that presence\\n2\\nof charge raises the tendency of a rotating black hole to support the NPV\\npropagation in its ergosphere. In a paper given in a book [25], J li general-\\nized the concept of negative medium to acoustic waves. In a recent paper,\\nVeselago [26] has explained how an electromagnetic wave transfers energy,\\nlinear momentum and mass in a negative refraction-medium.\\nIn the present paper, we discuss isothermal plasma wave properties of\\nthe Schwarzschild black hole in a Veselago medium. The format of the paper\\nis as follows: General line element and its formation in the Schwarzschild\\nplanar analogue is given in Section 2. In Section 3, perturbed and Fourier\\nanalyzed forms of 3+1 GRMHD equations for isothermal plasma are pre-\\nsented. Sections 4 and 5 contain the restricted 3 + 1 GRMHD equations for\\nrotating (non-magnetized and magnetized) plasmas and discussion related to\\nwave properties. Summary of the results is given in Section 6.\\n2\\nADM 3+1 Formalism and Schwarzschild\\nPlanar Analogue\\nThe general line element in ADM 3+1 formalism is given by [16]\\nds2 = −α2dt2 + γij(dxi + βidt)(dxj + βjdt),\\n(2.1)\\nwhere the lapse function α is the ratio of FIDO (ﬁducial observer) proper time\\nto universal time, i.e., α = dτ\\ndt , βi is the shift vector and γij (i, j = 1, 2, 3) are\\nthe components of three dimensional absolute space. FIDO is the natural\\nobserver associated with the above line element.\\nIn Schwarzschild planar\\nanalogue, shift vector vanishes due to zero angular momentum and γii = 1\\nrepresents Euclidean 3 geometry. Thus it reduces to the form [17]\\nds2 = −α2(z)dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + dz2,\\n(2.2)\\nwhere the directions z, x and y are analogous to the Schwarzschild coordi-\\nnates r, φ and θ respectively.\\n3\\n3+1 GRMHD Equations for Isothermal Plasma\\nin Veselago Medium\\nThe 3 + 1 GRMHD equations in a Veselago medium for the plasma present\\nin general line element and the Schwarzschild planar analogue (Eqs.(2.1) and\\n3\\n(2.2)) are given in Appendix A.

We suppose xz-plane for the velocity and magnetic ﬁeld of ﬂuid.\\nEquations (3.25)-(3.31) are the corresponding Fourier analyzed perturbed\\nGRMHD equations.\\n5.1\\nNumerical Solutions\\nFor magnetized background, we assume V F = 0 with u = V so that Eq.(3.8)\\ngives λ = 1. Also, we consider B =\\nq\\n176\\n7\\nwhich leads to B2\\n4π = 2. Further,\\nthe values of lapse function, velocity, pressure, density and speciﬁc enthalpy\\nremain the same as given in section 4.1. The above assumed values satisfy\\nthe perfect GRMHD Eqs.(3.2)-(3.6) for the range 1.5 ≤z ≤10, 0 ≤ω ≤10.\\nThe values of ﬂow constants are f = e = 1, l = −7.32001 and h = −1.76321.\\nAlso, we have u = V = −0.703562.\\nWe obtain the determinant of the\\ncoeﬃcients of constants by substituting these values in Eqs.(3.25) and (3.28)-\\n(3.31) which gives two dispersion relations. Also, c5 = 0 from Eqs.(3.26)-\\n(3.27). The dispersion relation obtained from the real part has the following\\nform\\nA1(z)k4 + A2(z, ω)k3 + A3(z, ω)k2 + A4(z, ω)k + A5(z, ω) = 0\\n(5.1)\\nwhile the imaginary part gives the following dispersion relation\\nB1(z)k5 + B2(z, ω)k4 + B3(z, ω)k3 + B4(z, ω)k2 + B5(z, ω)k\\n+B6(z, ω) = 0.\\n(5.2)\\nWe have used the software Mathematica to solve the above equations so that\\nthe roots can be displayed in terms of graphs. However, we could not ﬁnd\\nany graph of the roots. It seems that either all the roots are imaginary or\\nthere does not exist any wave in this region.\\n6\\nSummary\\nThis paper investigates the isothermal plasma wave properties of the Schwarzschild\\nmagnetosphere in a Veselago medium. For this purpose, we have re-formulated\\n16\\nthe Maxwell and 3 + 1 GRMHD equations by considering both permittivity\\nand permeability less than zero. The component and Fourier analysi of these\\nequations are derived for rotating plasma in non-magnetized and magnetized\\nbackgrounds.\\nFor the rotating non-magnetized plasma, our assumed values satisfy the\\n3 + 1 GRMHD equations in the region 1.5 ≤z ≤10. In Figures 1 and 2,\\nwaves move towards the event horizon. The dispersion is normal as well as\\nanomalous at random points in the ﬁrst ﬁgure while it is anomalous in the\\nsecond ﬁgure. The third ﬁgure indicates that waves move towards the event\\nhorizon while it has normal and anomalous dispersion of waves randomly. All\\nthe ﬁgures show that phase and group velocities are antiparallel. Refractive\\nindex is less than one and it increases in a small region near the event horizon.\\nFrom the previous literature [19] of the usual medium for isothermal plasma,\\nwe know that all waves move towards the event horizon. In the Veselago\\nmedium, Figure 3 indicates that waves move away from the event horizon.\\nThis is entirely a diﬀerent result in this unusual medium.\\nFor the usual\\nmedium, the value of refractive index is always greater than one while it is\\nless than one in all ﬁgures. This conﬁrms the presence of Veselago medium.\\nThe rotating magnetized case does not provide any explicit graph which\\nindicates that waves may not be found in the region 1.5 ≤z ≤10.\\nIt would be interesting to extend this work by assuming hot plasma in\\nthis unusual medium. The Kerr spacetime can also be used to analyze the\\nwave properties in this unusual medium.\\nAppendix A\\nIn Veselago medium (ǫ < 0, µ < 0), Maxwell equations, the GRMHD equa-\\ntions for the general line element and the Schwarzschild planar analogue are\\ngiven in this appendix.

Besides Carnot groups, we cover some (not all) Grushin spaces, for example,\\nthe following two families of vector ﬁelds\\nXj =\\n∂\\n∂xj\\n, j = 1, . . . , k,\\nXk+j = |x|2α\\n∂\\n∂xk+j\\n, j = 1, . . . , N −k\\n(1.3)\\nfor α ∈N and 1 ≤k < N, and\\nX1 =\\n∂\\n∂x1\\n, . . . , XN−1 =\\n∂\\n∂xN−1\\n, XN = xβ\\n1\\n∂\\n∂xN\\n(1.4)\\nfor β ∈Z+ are smooth and they satisfy the H¨ormander ﬁnite rank condition, there-\\nfore, our eigenvalue problem (1.1) comprises (1.3) and (1.4).\\n2. Preliminaries\\n2.1. H¨ormander vector ﬁelds. Let Ωbe a bounded connected open set in RN with\\nsmooth boundary ∂Ω, and let X1, . . . , Xm be a family of smooth vector ﬁelds, which\\nsatisﬁes the H¨ormander ﬁnite rank condition\\nrank (Lie {X1, . . . , Xm}) = N.\\nWe can deﬁne a metric on Ωinduced by {Xj}m\\nj=1 (see [10]).\\nDeﬁnition 2.1. Given any two points x, y ∈RN, the control distance dX(x, y)\\ninduced by the vector ﬁelds {Xj} is deﬁned as the inﬁmum of T > 0 such that\\nthere exists a piecewise C1 curve γ of X1, . . . , Xm with γ(0) = x and γ(T) = y.\\nThe pair (Ω, dX) is called the Carnot-Carath´eodory space. We recall 3 main ingre-\\ndients (Property 2.2, doubling condition (2.1) and Poincar´e inequality (2.3)) which\\nare necessery to get compact Sobolev embeddings (Theorem 2.9).\\nProperty 2.2. Carnot-Carath´eodory space (Ω, dX) is complete and length-space by\\n[13, Lemma 3.1].\\nProposition 2.3. For all r > 0 and x ∈Ω\\n′ ⋐Ωthere exists C > 0 such that the\\ndoubling condition\\n|B(x, 2r)| ≤C|B(x, r)|\\n(2.1)\\nholds (see [10, p. 111]), where\\nB(x, r) = {y ∈Ω| dX(x, y) < r}\\nand | · | is the Lebesgue measure in (2.1).\\nDeﬁnition 2.4. We call the number\\nQ = log2 C\\n(2.2)\\nthe local homogeneous dimension of Ω, where C is given in (2.1).\\nVARIATIONAL EIGENVALUES OF A QUASILINEAR SUBELLIPTIC EQUATION\\n3\\nThe notation X := (X1, . . . , Xm) stands for the horizontal gradient and\\n|Xu| =\\n m\\nX\\nj=1\\n(Xju)2\\n! 1\\n2\\n.\\nWe also recall a weak form of Jerison’s Poincar´e inequality [6]\\nZ\\nB\\n|u −uB|p dx ≤Crp\\nZ\\nαB\\n|Xu|pdx,\\n1 ≤p < ∞,\\n(2.3)\\nwhere B := B(x, r), αB := B (x, αr) with α, r > 0 and uB =\\n1\\n|B|\\nR\\nB udx (see also [5,\\np. 1122]).\\nThe distributional derivative of a function f along Xj is given by\\n⟨Xjf, ϕ⟩=\\nZ\\nΩ\\nfX∗\\nj ϕdx\\nfor all ϕ ∈C∞\\nc (Ω).\\nThroughout the paper we assume that p > 1 unless otherwise speciﬁed.\\nDeﬁnition 2.5. The Sobolev space L 1,p(Ω) is deﬁned as\\nL 1,p(Ω) := {f ∈Lp(Ω) : Xjf ∈Lp(Ω)\\nfor j = 1, . . . , m}\\nwith the norm\\n∥u∥L 1,p(Ω) :=\\n\\x12Z\\nΩ\\n|u|p + |Xu|p dx\\n\\x13 1\\np\\n.\\n(2.4)\\nDeﬁnition 2.6. The Sobolev space S1,p(Ω) is the completion of C∞(Ω) with respect\\nto the norm ∥· ∥L 1,p(Ω).\\nNote that S1,p(Ω) = L 1,p(Ω) by [5, Theorem 1.13].\\nDeﬁnition 2.7. The Sobolev space S1,p\\n0 (Ω) is the completion of C∞\\nc (Ω) in S1,p(Ω).\\nAnd it is a reﬂexive Banach space.\\nRemark 2.8. (Poincar´e inequality). There exists a constant C > 0 such that the\\ninequality\\nZ\\nΩ\\n|u|pdx ≤C\\nZ\\nΩ\\n|Xu|pdx\\n(2.5)\\nholds for all u ∈S1,p\\n0 (Ω). Here C does not depend on u.\\nThe Sobolev space S1,p\\n0 (Ω) has also the equivalent norm\\n∥u∥:=\\n\\x12Z\\nΩ\\n|Xu|p dx\\n\\x13 1\\np\\n.\\n(2.6)\\nThe notation ∥· ∥without a subscript is only used for (2.6) in the sequel.\\nThe hypotheses given in [5, pp. 1084-1085] are satisﬁed by Property 2.2, dou-\\nbling condition (2.1) and Poincar´e inequality (2.3), thus ensuring compact Sobolev\\nembeddings.\\nTheorem 2.9. [5, Theorem 1.28]\\n(1) Let 1 ≤p < Q. Then for all 1 ≤q <\\nQp\\nQ−p the embedding S1,p\\n0 (Ω) ֒→Lq(Ω) is\\ncompact.\\n4\\nM. KARAZYM\\n(2) Let Q ≤p < ∞. Then for all 1 ≤q < ∞the embedding S1,p\\n0 (Ω) ֒→Lq(Ω) is\\ncompact.\\n2.2. Nonlinear operators. Let X be an inﬁnite dimensional real reﬂexive Banach\\nspace. Its dual space is denoted by X∗. For all ω ∈X∗and u ∈X we set a dual\\npair ⟨ω, u⟩= ω(u). Strong convergence in either X and X∗is denoted by →. Weak\\nconvergence in either X and X∗is denoted by ⇀.\\nDeﬁnition 2.10. An operator T : X →X∗is strongly continuous if\\nwhenever\\nun ⇀u\\nin X\\n=⇒\\nTun →Tu\\nin X∗.\\nDeﬁnition 2.11. An operator T : X →X∗is uniformly monotone if there exists\\na strictly monotonically increasing continuous function a : R+ →R+ with values\\na(0) = 0 and a(t) →+∞as t →+∞such that\\n⟨Tu −Tv, u −v⟩≥a(∥u −v∥)∥u −v∥\\nholds for all u, v ∈X.\\nDeﬁnition 2.12. We say that an operator T : X →X∗satisﬁes condition (S)0, if\\nfor every sequence {un} in X such that\\nun ⇀u\\nin X,\\nTun ⇀v\\nin X∗\\n⟨Tun, un⟩→⟨v, u⟩\\nin R,\\n,\\n(2.7)\\nwe have un →u in X.\\nDeﬁnition 2.13. A functional T ∈C1(X, R) is said to satisfy the local Palais-Smale\\ncondition at level c ∈R, in short (PS)c, if {un} ⊂X is a sequence such that\\n(1) T (un) →c;\\n(2) T ′(un) →0 in X∗,\\nthen {un} has a convergent subsequence.\\nDeﬁnition 2.14. Let M ⊂X \\\\{0} be a symmetric compact subset. We say that the\\nset M has genus n, denoted by γ(M) = n, if there exists an odd continuous operator\\nh : M →Rn \\\\{0}, where n ∈N is the smallest number holding this property.
